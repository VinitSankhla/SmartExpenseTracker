# SmartExpenseTracker
A simple Java console application for robust, personal expense management. Empowers users to manage daily finances by adding, viewing, categorizing, and deleting expense entries. Built using core Java OOP concepts: classes, objects, constructors, methods, and ArrayList. Contains three core, highly-modular classes: Main.java → handles the user interface and menu interaction

Expense.java → encapsulates the data for each expense record

ExpenseManager.java → manages all operational logic: add, view, delete, and calculate total

Follows a clean, modular structure, ensuring high readability and easy future extension. Screenshots are included in the /screenshots folder for demonstration. This project elegantly showcases the practical application of Java basics to solve a common financial management problem.
